This project contains sample codes for building a static map with predefined bus and coach routes. It includes an area on the map with highlighted routes and annotations and markers.

We can add maps based on Google Maps data with the Maps SDK for Android to our application. Access to Google Maps servers, map display, data downloading, and response to map gestures is all handled by the API automatically. By using API calls, we can also add to a basic map markers, polylines, and overlays, and change the user's view of a particular map area. 
Markers are simply icons anchored to specific positions on the map; Polylines are Sets of line segments; Ground Overlays are Bitmap graphics anchored to specific positions on the map. These objects provide additional information for map locations, and allow user interaction with the map. 

On top of that, the Directions API is utilized in this app to provide all necessary coordinates data to the Maps SDK so it will be able to draw the best routes to get from A to Z, providing users with high-quality directions.
